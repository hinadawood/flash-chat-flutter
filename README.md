# flash-chat-flutter

## This flutter app has been created by incorporating Firebase services. I have used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as Firebase Authentication in the app with cloud-based noSQL database.

- This flutter app is a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.

- Steps to use the chat messaging service created in this app :-

1. Run this app in iOS simulator and register yourself with an email id on Registration screen.
2. Run this app in Android simulator and register with <b>another</b> email id on Registration screen.
3. Now send a message in iOS simulator and see it getting shown in Android simulator. Similarly type and send message in Android simulator and see it getting received by the user on iOS simulator. Messages get shown along with the email id of the person who is typing the message.
4. Logout by clicking cross icon on Chat screen.
5. You can login again on Login screen using the same email id with which you registered.
